<p>This is harder than it looks.</p>
<blockquote><p>The value of a Field on Level 2 cannot be used more than once.</p></blockquote>
<p>Say we have a Page with 2 Scrolls and a data structure something like this:</p>
<pre>-Level 1
SEQNO [key]

  -Level 2
  SEQNO [key]
  SOME_FIELD</pre>
<p>Super simple stuff. (level 0 has no keys)</p>
<p>Note that the data structure allows us to enter a specific value in some_field more than once. For example:</p>
<pre>seqno = 1, some_field = "abc"
seqno = 2, some_field = "abc"</pre>
<p>So we can't rely on the (awesome) component buffer to simply check uniqueness for us.</p>
<blockquote><p>Write: code to detect duplicate values in some_field.</p></blockquote>
<p>1 point for: preventing duplicates.</p>
<p>2 points for: highlighting all duplicates.</p>
<p>3 points for: making it modular. (although this is such a rare situation).</p>
<p>To save a few minutes looking up the small stuff:</p>
<pre>Field.Style = "PSERROR"/"PSEDITBOX";
Error MsgGet(0, 0, "Found duplicates.");</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
