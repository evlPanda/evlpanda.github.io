<p>Man, global variables get a bad rap. There seems to be a general rule that if you use a global variable you are a bad programmer (not dissimilar to using distinct in sql).</p>
<p>Global variables exist for a reason.</p>
<p>I think people do not understand that reason. They are there as variables that follow a user around at <strong>the session level</strong>. Way, way, waaay up top. The very top for the client. above this are only server variables, and cookies too I suppose.</p>
<p>There's an excellent write up on how to <em>misunderstand</em> global variables on the <a href="https://www.cedarhillsgroup.com/knowledge-base/kbarticles/application-classes-and-global-variables-like-oil-and-water/">Cedar Hills blog</a>. The example they have given is spot-on. That is how you can screw up your code by <em>misunderstanding</em> global variables. It's a good read.</p>
<p>But the last line irks me:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Please do not use Global variables in Application Classes. In Fact, if you are using global variables at all in PeopleTools you are probably doing something incorrectly."</p></blockquote>
<p>You <em>can</em> use global variables in Application Classes, or anywhere for that matter. They exist for a reason. Again, you have to understand that they are at <strong>the session level</strong>. They don't go away until the user ends their session. This is great if you want to simply store a value tied to a user as they move around the system without having to ever resort to the database.</p>
<p>They are persistent to a user's session. That is <em>why</em> they are called <span style="text-decoration:underline;">global</span> variables, not local variables. Use them as such and you'll be fine. (I'm using one in a Class right now (brave or what?)).</p>
