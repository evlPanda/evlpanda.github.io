<p>Lifted from Praj's most excellent Wiki:<br /><a href="http://peoplesoft.wikidot.com">http://peoplesoft.wikidot.com</a></p>
<p>The table PS_PRCSSEQUENCE stores the last sequence numbers for the Process Scheduler and Report Manager. In PeopleTools 8.48.15 there are 5 process sequence keys (PRCSSEQKEY) which you can view yourself by looking at the translates on this field:</p>
<blockquote><p>0 = Process Instance<br />1 = Report Instance<br />2 = Transfer Instance<br />3 = Report ID<br />4 = Folder ID</p></blockquote>
<p>It's probably a good health check to ensure that the numbers in PS_PRCSSEQUENCE match those in the relevant tables:</p>
<blockquote><p>select max(PRCSINSTANCE) as PRCSSEQKEY0 from PSPRCSRQST;<br />select max(CONTENTID) PRCSSEQKEY1 from PS_CDM_AUTH;<br />select max(TRANSFERINSTANCE) PRCSSEQKEY2 from PS_CDM_LIST;<br />select max(PSRF_REPORT_ID) PRCSSEQKEY3 from PSRF_RINFO_TBL;<br />select max(PSRF_FOLDER_ID) PRCSSEQKEY4 from PSRF_FINFO_TBL;</p></blockquote>
<p>Especially if you happen to be clearing out data from these tables manually. I guess if you do clear out processes/reports you'll want to update the PS_PRCSSEQUENCE accordingly.</p>
