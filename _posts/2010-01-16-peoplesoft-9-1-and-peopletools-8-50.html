Quite a lot. The first ten minutes is a summary of how well Oracle/PeopleSoft is doing. Skip this for a demonstration of the new technology, namely DHTML and AJAX. It is really nice to finally see some examples in an ERP. Doesn't appear to be much in the way of PeopleCode though, not like the jump to 8 for example.
