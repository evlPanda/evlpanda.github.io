<p>Found some delivered code that actually made things easier for once.  Unbelievable I know.<br />It even has excellent, descriptive comments!!!</p>
<p>Check the Application Package SCM_ARCH_ATTACH.UI.AttachmentHandler</p>
<p>1. Make sure your record contains the attachment fields SCM_ATTACH_ID and ATT_VERSION (ATTACHUSERFILE would be nice too for the user given filename)</p>
<p>2. Place the fields from Record.PV_ATTACH_WRK on the same scroll level.</p>
<p>3. Enjoy.</p>
