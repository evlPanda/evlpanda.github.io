<p>After building this twice now, both while specs were being written (sigh) I suggest the following approach.</p>
<p>Multiple App Engines. </p>
<p>Main: Contains main outer loop(s)<br />Grouping Code: Contains calls to Element AEs<br />Element: Contains Section for each Element calculation.<br />Functions: Sections for populating component arrays and the like<br />Population: AE that deals only with splitting, account code mapping and population of temp tables.</p>
<p>... something lik ethat. Would make things more legible, pluggable.</p>
<p><b>The need for an environment that has accurate pay run data to compare against cannot be stressed enough, preferably dev.</b> The lag between code changes and migrations and runs in downstream envs that have comparable data can be days, very slow and confusing.</p>
