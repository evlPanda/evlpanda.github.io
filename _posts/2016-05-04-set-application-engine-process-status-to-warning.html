<pre><code>ADO_EI_AET.AE_APPSTATUS = 1; /* Update process status to Warning. Magic. */</code></pre>
<p>Simply add the Field AE_APPSTATUS to the main AET table for your Application Engine and set it to 1 if you want the process status to be Warning rather than Success.</p>
<p>Useful if you have an error log for example that you want the user to be aware of, even though everything ran to success.</p>
