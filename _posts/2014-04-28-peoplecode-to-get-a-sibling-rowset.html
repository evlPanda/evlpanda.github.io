<p>For some reason this just took me far too long to figure out. Must be getting old. Writing down for reference.</p>
<p>Let's say you have a page with a Record structure like this:</p>
<p>Parent<br />   Sibling 1<br />   Sibling 2</p>
<p>And you want some code/event on Sibling 1 to change the data in Sibling 2.</p>
<p>The somewhat unusual scenario I had is that Sibling 2 is a kind of audit record for Sibling 1, so that every time data changed on Sibling 1 a new row was inserted into Sibling 2 with Oprid and DateTime etc.</p>
<p>Normally you could just have Sibling 2 as a child of Sibling 1 (and technically it is) but in my scenario Sibling 1 was already at Level 3. The data  was to be displayed. I had no room to move. </p>
<p>Place the following in something like SIBLING_1.Field1.SaveEdit()</p>
<pre style="background-color:#eeeeee;border:1px dashed #999999;color:black;font-family:Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace;font-size:12px;line-height:14px;overflow:auto;padding:5px;width:100%;"><code>Local Rowset &amp;rsSIBLING_2 = GetRowset().ParentRow.GetRowset(Scroll.SIBLING_2);<br /></code></pre>
<p>You'll now have the sibling Record as a RowSet.</p>
<p><i>.ParentRow</i> is the property of the RowSet you are looking for.</p>
