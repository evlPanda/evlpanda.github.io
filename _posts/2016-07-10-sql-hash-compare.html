<p>This can be used to compare two sets of parent-child data against each other. There are intricacies and seemingly never ending exceptions (including contradicting exceptions) when comparing two sets of parent-child data which I won't go into except to say be warned.</p>
<p>Here is a complete solution that mimics the way people compare two sets of parent-child data; by flattening the data in their minds first.</p>
<p>First of all the data. I've chosen a set of shops, which is not the best analogy but go with it.</p>
<pre><code>
with parent_data as (
	select 1 as id, 'Fruit Store' as type from sysibm.sysdummy1 union
	select 2 as id, 'Pet Store' as type from sysibm.sysdummy1 union
	select 3 as id, 'Bakery' as type from sysibm.sysdummy1
)

, child_data as (
	select 1 as id, 1 as parent_id, 'Apple'  as item, 1.0 as price, date('2016-07-19') as use_by_date from sysibm.sysdummy1 union
	select 2 as id, 1 as parent_id, 'Pear'   as item, 1.5 as price, date('2016-07-20') as use_by_date from sysibm.sysdummy1 union
	select 3 as id, 1 as parent_id, 'Orange' as item, 1.7 as price, date('2016-07-21') as use_by_date from sysibm.sysdummy1 union

	select 4 as id, 2 as parent_id, 'Puppy'  as item, 55  as price, cast(null as date) as use_by_date from sysibm.sysdummy1 union
	select 5 as id, 2 as parent_id, 'Kitten' as item, 40  as price, cast(null as date) as use_by_date from sysibm.sysdummy1 union

	select 6 as id, 3 as parent_id, 'Bread'  as item, 1.6 as price, date('2016-07-10') as use_by_date from sysibm.sysdummy1 union
	select 7 as id, 3 as parent_id, 'Cake'   as item, 17  as price, date('2016-07-15') as use_by_date from sysibm.sysdummy1 union
	select 8 as id, 3 as parent_id, 'Bagel'  as item, 0.8 as price, date('2016-07-10') as use_by_date from sysibm.sysdummy1 union
)
</code></pre>
<p>Next we'll concatenate all the 'properties' of each of the child data rows:</p>
<pre><code>
, numbered_sets (id, type, hash, rownum) as (
	select 
	  p.id
	, p.type
	, replace(trim(c.item) || char(trim(price)) || char(nvl(use_by_date, '3000-01-01')), ' ',  '') as hash
	, rownumber() over(partition by p.id, p.type order by c.id) as rownum
	from
	  parent_data p
		left outer join child_data c
		on c.parent_id = p.id
)
</code></pre>
<p>This gives us the following:</p>
<pre><code>
ID          TYPE        HASH                           ROWNUM              
----------- ----------- ------------------------------ ------

          1 Fruit Store Pear1.52016-07-20                   2
          1 Fruit Store Orange1.72016-07-21                 3
          2 Pet Store   Puppy55.03000-01-01                 1
          2 Pet Store   Kitten40.03000-01-01                2
          3 Bakery      Bread1.62016-07-10                  1
          3 Bakery      Cake17.02016-07-15                  2
          3 Bakery      Bagel.82016-07-10                   3
</code></pre>
<p>And now we can make the final move to completely flatten all data about each store:</p>
<pre><code>
, navigate_sets (id, type, hash_list, rownum) as (

	select 
	  n.id
	, n.type
	, trim(cast(n.hash as varchar(200)))
	, n.rownum
	from numbered_sets n
	where n.rownum = 1

	union all

	select 
	  s.id
	, s.type
	, trim(n.hash_list || s.hash) -- &lt;&lt; super hash
	, s.rownum
	from numbered_sets s
		inner join navigate_sets n
		on n.id = s.id
		and n.type = s.type
		and n.rownum + 1 = s.rownum
)

select id, type, max(hash_list) as hash from navigate_sets group by id, type
</code></pre>
<p>Giving us our final set of completely flattened data for each store:</p>
<pre><code>
ID          TYPE        HASH

<p>This can be your 'A' side of a compare. Do the same as above with your 'B' side and then simply run <i>SELECT * FROM A MINUS SELECT * FROM B</i> to compare the two sets of data.</p>
