<p>From a recent email from a collegue.  It seems that <span style="font-style:italic;">For<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span></span> loops only evaluate the conditions once, when the loop is entered:</p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have just encountered an ‘interesting’ property of for loops.</p>
<p>It appears that they hard-code the number that they loop through until, and there doesn’t seem to be any way to affect this number.</p>
<p>I.e. If you have a rowset and are looping through it via a for loop - &amp;I = 1 to &amp;rowset.activerowcount, and you add a row to the rowset, the for loop will only go through the original number of rows – the added row will not be part of the &amp;rowset.activerowcount of the loop. (If there were originally 10 rows in the rowset, and I add another 5 rows to the rowset as part of the for loop, &amp;I will only ever get to 10 – not 15).</p>
<p>If you wish to loop through a rowset (or any variable number loops) you should use a while or a repeat loop, as the conditions <span style="font-weight:bold;">are re-evaluated</span> each time the loop comes to the conditional part (the top of the while statement, and the until of the repeat statement).</p>
<p>Hope that helps people.</p>
