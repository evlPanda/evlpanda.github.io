<blockquote>A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. - Dune</p></blockquote>
<p>Frankly, I've forgotten the beginning. I'm sure I could balance it all at one time, twenty years ago, but it seems I can't balance page levels, prompts, their views, and related displays any more. I've spent so long in Application Engines, Integration Broker, SQL tuning, OOP, and all the other things that I've forgotten how to do basic stuff on basic pages; PeopleSoft 101.</p>
<p>So I'm writing this down for the next time I forget.</p>
<p>Here is a Record:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-481" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screen-shot-2018-05-03-at-7-12-56-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-05-03 at 7.12.56 pm" width="773" height="200" /></p>
<p>Fields 1 - 5 are keys.<br />
The last field has a <strong>prompt</strong>, to this Record:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-482" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screen-shot-2018-05-03-at-7-00-25-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-05-03 at 7.00.25 pm" width="783" height="291" /></p>
<p>The prompt will auto fill and make display only all the values for its keys that it finds in the buffer. In this case institution, strm, session_code and scent_combined_id.</p>
<p>The fields must be defined as a key for this to work, even thought it's just a view.</p>
<p><strong>Think %Join(common_keys, ...)</strong></p>
<p>So when we use the prompt:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-483" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screen-shot-2018-05-03-at-7-19-55-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-05-03 at 7.19.55 pm" width="470" height="452" /></p>
<p>We see the four key values copied (joined) from the buffer.</p>
<p>Now, if you wanted to, for what ever reason, have strm as a value the user can enter make it an Alternate Search Key instead. The result is you can now search on strm; it is no longer filled in automagically from the buffer.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-484" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screen-shot-2018-05-03-at-7-25-40-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-05-03 at 7.25.40 pm" width="501" height="308" /></p>
<p>The other thing I stumbled on was the value that is actually <em>returned</em> to the Field with the prompt; the value you are searching for.</p>
<p><strong>The last key is the value returned.</strong></p>
<p>If you look at the prompt record again you'll see I've set it as ssr_activity_id. This is what is returned; the last key in the record definition.</p>
