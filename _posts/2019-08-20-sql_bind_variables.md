We can't combine bind variables and the "IN" clause, but there is another way.

You canâ€™t do this:

{% highlight sql %}
select 1
from psroleuser
where roleuser = :1
and rolename in (:2)
[% endhighlight %}

```rolename in (:2)``` just doesn't work : (

However, you can do this ...rather more complex method:

{% highlight sql %}
select 1
from psroleuser
where roleuser = :1
and rolename in (
   select regexp_substr(:2, '[^,]+', 1, level) token
   from dual
   connect by level <= length(:2) - length(replace(:2, ',', '')) + 1
)
[% endhighlight %}
