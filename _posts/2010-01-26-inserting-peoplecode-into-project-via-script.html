<p>Sometimes you want to do big compares between environments, and you've got a rather large component, say Component.PERSONAL_DATA, and you've gone through and manually inserted all the pages, subpages, subpages-subpages and so on, including all the Records.</p>
<p>But doing this hasn't automatically inserted all the Record PeopleCode! Yuck, you have to go through each record... and ... no!!!</p>
<p>Now I've written this I can see it wouldn't be much of a leap to expand on this script to be able to just pass in a Component name. I'll leave that to you.</p>
<p>This script will insert all Record PeopleCode for all the Records in a given Project. Note you may have to clear you PeopleTools cache after you've run the script to see it in the given Project.</p>
<blockquote><p>INSERT INTO PSPROJECTITEM<br />(SELECT DISTINCT<br />'PROJECT_NAME', 8<br />, OBJECTID1, OBJECTVALUE1, OBJECTID2, OBJECTVALUE2, OBJECTID3, OBJECTVALUE3, OBJECTID4, OBJECTVALUE4<br />, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0<br />FROM PSPCMPROG<br />WHERE OBJECTVALUE1 IN<br />(SELECT OBJECTVALUE1<br />FROM PSPROJECTITEM<br />WHERE PROJECTNAME = 'PROJECT_NAME'<br />AND OBJECTTYPE=0));</p></blockquote>
