<p>This can be fun. I had a lot of trouble with an error message stating I couldn't install the plug-in while Word was running. Shut down process after process to no avail.</p>
<p>Solution: <br />1. Download to your desktop the install file from Main Menu &gt; Reporting Tools &gt; XML Publisher &gt; Setup &gt; Design Helper.<br />2. Restart the machine in Safe Mode and install.</p>
<p>I also encountered further problems when trying to use some of the features such as the Chart object. Reinstall BI Publisher by navigating to: C:\Program Files\Oracle\BI Publisher\BI Publisher Desktop\DotNetInstallFiles\setup.exe and following the prompts (next, ok, next, yes etc.)</p>
