<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Problem:</span><br />We found a problem when tring to download to spreadsheets from grids.  IE wouldn't open the spreadsheet, just refreshed a few times and then nothing.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Resolution:</span><br />Tools/Internet Options/<br />Security/Custom Level/<br />Downloading/Automatic prompting for downloads - tick enable.</p>
