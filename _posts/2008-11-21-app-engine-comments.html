<p>Would seem that you can make comments in App Engine SQL Actions if:</p>
<p>#1 You use the /* */ commenting standard,<br />#2 Comments are <span style="font-weight:bold;">after </span>the WHERE clause.<br />#3 Comments do not contain a "%", such as <span style="font-weight:bold;">%</span>Table(RecName).</p>
