<p>This class acts like it says on the box and is a debugging utility. Specifically for Application Engines. A work in progress.</p>
<p><code><br />
import YOUR_LIBRARY:Utilities:AEDebug:*;</code></p>
<p>&amp;debug = create ADO_EI_LIBRARY:Utilities:AEDebug();<br />
&amp;debug.logFile = &amp;logFile;<br />
&amp;debug.logFileData = &amp;logFileData;</p>
<p>&amp;debug.LogTempTable("AE_TEMP_TABLE_TAO");</p>
<p>I've recently added in the JQuery bit, and 'sticky' table headings, but haven't really been on a platform that will handle it (old version of IE).</p>
<p>Er, reading the code now I am not sure how it actually works. It really does always get the correct AE Temp Table instance. Black Magic.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: made minor alterations in text edit before saving online. May be typos.</p>
<p><strong>The code doesn't format very well in this blog so here's a link. <a href="https://thepeoplesoftexperience.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/aedebug-class.pdf">AEDebug Class</a></strong></p>
