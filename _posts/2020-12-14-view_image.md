blurb: How to view Images in PeopleSoft

If doing this often I'd copy the page we are about to go to, and make my own component. This is perfectly good for "one time" however.

*PeopleTools > Portal > Portal Utilities > Navigation Collections*

Add a new Navigation Collection (we won't save it). Once you enter a Name and move to anothe field the 'Override Default Options' group box displays.

Click 'Add folder'

Click the search button on 'Override Image' and you are presented with a well handy little page to view images.
