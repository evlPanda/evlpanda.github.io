After years of fighting with Blogger and WordPress I have finally stumbled across [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

Finally, a super simple blogging platform that I can write in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)!

Stylesheet is using the [solarized dark theme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized), and Consolas type face.
