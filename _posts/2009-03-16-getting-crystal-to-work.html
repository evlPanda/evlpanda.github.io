<p>Oh Crystal, when will you be <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">decommissioned</span>?</p>
<p>Sometimes Crystal just doesn't want to play ball.  Here's what I recently found:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the report was using my <span style="font-style:italic;">local ODBC connection</span> for its Database Connection it didn't work on the Server.  Of course.</p>
<p>I was receiving the following error message:
<pre>Crystal Reports Print Engine error text: Error in File e:\psoft\s90dev\crw\eng\usqsf3p.rpt:<br />Unable to connect: .rpt:<br />Unable to connect: incorrect log on parameters. %6 %7 %8 %9 (65,30)<br />Message Set Number: 65<br />Message Number: 30<br />Message Reason: Crystal Reports Print Engine error text: Error in File e:\psoft\s90dev\crw\eng\usqsf3p.rpt:<br />Unable to connect: .rpt:<br />Unable to connect: incorrect log on parameters. %6 %7 %8 %9 (65,30)<br /></pre>
<p>This can be simply corrected by using the following steps:</p>
<p>- Go to 'Database/Set Datasource Location...'<br />- Create a new connection.</p>
<p><a href="https://thepeoplesoftexperience.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/330d5-screenhunter_01mar-1612-48.gif"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/330d5-screenhunter_01mar-1612-48.gif?w=300" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5313624307058174930" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>- Select both Current Data Source in top pane and new one in bottom, click 'Update'.<br />- Verify the database.<br />- Save and perhaps even open and close to ...do something.</p>
<p>... or just never using a local ODBC connection (duh?).</p>
</li>
<li>Which user to use for the connection prior to migrating out of DEV and eventually into PROD?
</li>
<li>Subreport links.
<p>If found I had to use the following ("sameish" for run control id):</p>
<p><a href="https://thepeoplesoftexperience.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/401d1-screenhunter_02mar-1613-37.gif"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/401d1-screenhunter_02mar-1613-37.gif?w=300" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5313624689658667282" border="0" /></a></li>
</ol>
