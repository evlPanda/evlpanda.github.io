<p>Rather than create a printable version of a page that is a copy of a given page sans buttons, headers and other elements that don't look good on a hard-copy, you can add a simple button and then define which fields you don't want to be printable. Much easier.</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Add a button or link to your page.</li>
<li>Under the Push Button/Hyperlink Page Properties setup as follows:<br />Destination = 'External Link'<br />External Link = 'Dynamic'</li>
<li>Add some PeopleCode:<br />DERIVED_REC.JS_PRINT.Value = "javascript:window.print()";
<p>Now you have a basic link on your page that when clicked will print it from the browser.</li>
<li>Add a HTML Area to the page with the following value:
<p>  <code><br />@media print {<br />#PAGEBAR, .PSHEADERTOOLBARFRAME, #PRINT_BTN,<br />#INFO,<br />#DERIVED_REC_JS_PRINT { display: none }<br />}<br /> </code>  </p>
<p>Note that #DERIVED_REC_JS_PRINT is the link you made in step 1.<br />#Info in this example is a chunk of HTML text I wrapped in <code><span id="Info"> </span></code><br />You can add any field, usually in the format RECORD_NAME_FIELD_NAME, check your HTML source to be sure.</li>
</ol>
