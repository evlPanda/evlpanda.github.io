<p>When using the Excel-To-CI spreadsheets fields are processed in the same order that they appear on the records in the CI.  A problem can occur if field A is using the value of field B to populate a key value on its prompt table as field B will be populated after field A.  Note again that the order these fields appear on the page is not taken into consideration.</p>
<p>To get around this problem you need to add a Derived Work record field on the page, up at level ) that will copy its value to Field B.  This DW field will be populated 1st.</p>
