<p>To be honest I'm not sure playing games that are so similar to actual work are fun, or relaxing, but they seem a good way to introduce people, your own children especially, to the concept of or concepts similar to coding. I much prefer more relaxing, problem-solving pursuits like <a href="http://67.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkvl17wsJa1qhi56lo1_500.jpg">Muay Thai</a>.</p>
<h3>TIS-100</h3>

<p>TIS-100 is an open-ended programming game by Zachtronics, the creators of SpaceChem and Infinifactory, in which you rewrite corrupted code segments to repair the TIS-100 and unlock its secrets. It’s the assembly language programming game you never asked for!</p>
<h3>Cube Composer</h3>

<p>A puzzle game which is inspired by functional programming methods. In a number of different levels, your task is to compose a series of transformations such that the colored cubes arrange in the correct pattern.</p>
