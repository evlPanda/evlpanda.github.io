<p>Hello code.org :)</p>
<p>I've recently found code.org and they have an <em>amazing</em> collection of code tutorials that you may already know of via their <em>one hour of code</em> endeavour.</p>
<p>But they also have a collection of Computer Science courses that are perfect for teaching bored kids about how stuff really works. I especially like their methodology of "activity &gt;  comprehension &gt; vocabulary", or words to that effect. This has the students describing a problem, solving it, and then learning about what they just did. Essentially the students are <em>rediscovering</em> the very foundations of computer science themselves. It's a much better approach than a dry lecture about words you are unfamiliar with.</p>
