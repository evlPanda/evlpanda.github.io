<p>It looks like by default it is not in 'development' mode, and you can't make changes to the delivered Context Definition, or its Selection Mapping.<br />Change the configured value and all the fields on the configuration pages become editable.</p>
<p> SELECT *<br />FROM PS_SCCPS_INSTALL;</p>
<p>This should equal 'DEV'.</p>
