<p>In short if you want a process's output to appear in the RDS it has to end up residing in the same folder that is created for the process at run-time.</p>
<p>For this example we are going to be producing a .ltr file using an SQR process called 'PROCNAME'.  In the end we want a file path like this, where 501 is the Process Instance number:<br /><span><span style="font-size:85%;"></span></span><span><!--[endif]--></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">/opt/psoft8/HE900D9A/appserv/prcs/HE90D9A/log_output/SQR_PROCNAME_501/SQR_PROCNAME_501.LTR</span></p>
<p>Note that up to "log_output' is most likely going to be a system variable, set in something like setfile.sqc so it can be modified for each environment.</p>
<p>Note that the folder name (SQR_PROCNAME_501) <span style="font-weight:bold;">must </span>be in this format, where 'SQR' is the Process Type, 'PROCNAME' is the Process Name and '501' is the Process Instance Number.</p>
<p>The file name syntax is the same as the folder name (although at time of writing I think you may actually be able to get away with whatever file name you please).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Update: </span>It appears App Engines require the files to be in the strict format "AE_ProcName_ProcInstance.*" where * is an extension.  This was working when output type was Web/TXT.</p>
<p>The SQR code looks something like this:<br /><span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;"><br />#DEFINE FILEPREFIX    e:\psoft8\he900d9a\appserv\prcs\HE90D9A\log_output\</p>
<p>! Folder<br />Move '{FILEPREFIX}' to $fileName<br />Concat 'SQR_PROCNAME_' with $fileName<br />Concat $prcs_process_instance with $fileName<br />Concat '\' with $fileName</p>
<p>! File.<br />Concat 'PROCNAME_' with $fileName<br />Concat $prcs_process_instance with $fileName<br />Concat '.LTR' with $fileName</p>
<p>New-Report $fileName<br /></span></p>
