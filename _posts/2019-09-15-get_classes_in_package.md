This example code creates an array of all AppClasses in an AppPackage. Useful for any pattern that uses multiple sub-classes of the same type.

In this example there is an interface and all AppClasses in the AppPackage are of this type; PRIOR_RECOGNITION:AutoAssess:Assessments:AssessmentInt. They all have a common method or two.

The Array is an array of the same type. The SQL filters out the interface itself.

This is well handy to enforce the single responsibility principle; each class in the package does its own thing.

This method allows you to add more AppClasses to the AppPackage and theyâ€™ll all available to the client without changing any code.

{% highlight java %}
method createAssessments
   &Assessments = CreateArrayRept(create PRIOR_RECOGNITION:AutoAssess:Assessments:AssessmentInt(), 0);
   Local string &packageRoot = "PRIOR_RECOGNITION";
   Local string &path = "AutoAssess:Assessments";
   Local SQL &AssessmentsObjectsSQL = CreateSQL("select appclassid from psappclassdefn where packageroot = :1 and qualifypath = :2 and appclassid  'AssessmentInt'", &packageRoot, &path);
   Local string &appClass;
   While &AssessmentsObjectsSQL.Fetch(&appClass)
      &Assessments.Push(CreateObject(&packageRoot | ":" | &path | ":" | &appClass));
   End-While;
end-method;
