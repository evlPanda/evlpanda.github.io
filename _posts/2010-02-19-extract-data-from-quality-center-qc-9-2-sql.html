<p>Quality Center is a testing suite used at a few installations. It comes with a collection of reports, including its own report generator.</p>
<p>Nonetheless it is nice to be able to get the RAW data and do with it what you will.</p>

<p>You can also join to the Test Lab to get the Test Results out. Note that it is joined by TEST_ID so the Lab folders may not line up with the Plan folders, you can change folder names etc.</p>
