<meta name="description" content="Definately the most irritating error I come across, the &quot;No matching buffer&quot; error. I find this especially irritating as PeopleTools has found the error but refuses to give you any clue as to which scroll/data combination is causing it. Sometimes the problem can be quickly identified by looking through the data in the component, for example a drop down box may be showing &#39;invalid value&#39;, which could lead you quickly to the offending data. But how to actually get into the component to take a look around? That damn error message is stopping you from opening the component. Ctrl + J. Pressing this combination displays information about the component. The magic bit is that by clicking &#39;continue&#39;, or Ctrl + J again, the component will open complete with the data that is valid. A simple, obvious but useful start to tracking down the cause of the dreaded &quot;no matching buffer&quot; error. If you can quickly identify where the problem may be by looking for clues in the component you can save a lot of time, frustration and especially boredom by not having to troll through a potentially large and complex component, page-by-page, scroll-by-scroll." />
