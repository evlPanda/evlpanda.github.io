<meta name="description" content="For some reason this just took me far too long to figure out. Must be getting old. Writing down for reference. Let&#39;s say you have a page with a Record structure like this: Parent   Sibling 1   Sibling 2 And you want some code/event on Sibling 1 to change the data in Sibling 2. The somewhat unusual scenario I had is that Sibling 2 is a kind of audit record for Sibling 1, so that every time data changed on Sibling 1 a new row was inserted into Sibling 2 with Oprid and DateTime etc. Normally you could just have Sibling 2 as a child of Sibling 1 (and technically it is) but in my scenario Sibling 1 was already at Level 3. The data  was to be displayed. I had no room to move. Place the following in something like SIBLING_1.Field1.SaveEdit() Local Rowset &amp;rsSIBLING_2 = GetRowset().ParentRow.GetRowset(Scroll.SIBLING_2); You&#39;ll now have the sibling Record as a RowSet. .ParentRow is the property of the RowSet you are looking for." />
