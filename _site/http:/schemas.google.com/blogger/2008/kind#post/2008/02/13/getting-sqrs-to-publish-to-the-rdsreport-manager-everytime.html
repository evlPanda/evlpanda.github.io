<meta name="description" content="See Also: http://capital-it.blogspot.com/2008/09/publishing-files-to-report-managerrds.html In short if you want a process&#39;s output to appear in the RDS it has to end up residing in the same folder that is created for the process at run-time. For this example we are going to be producing a .ltr file using an SQR process called &#39;PROCNAME&#39;. In the end we want a file path like this, where 501 is the Process Instance number:/opt/psoft8/HE900D9A/appserv/prcs/HE90D9A/log_output/SQR_PROCNAME_501/SQR_PROCNAME_501.LTR Note that up to &quot;log_output&#39; is most likely going to be a system variable, set in something like setfile.sqc so it can be modified for each environment. Note that the folder name (SQR_PROCNAME_501) must be in this format, where &#39;SQR&#39; is the Process Type, &#39;PROCNAME&#39; is the Process Name and &#39;501&#39; is the Process Instance Number. The file name syntax is the same as the folder name (although at time of writing I think you may actually be able to get away with whatever file name you please). Update: It appears App Engines require the files to be in the strict format &quot;AE_ProcName_ProcInstance.*&quot; where * is an extension. This was working when output type was Web/TXT. The SQR code looks something like this:#DEFINE FILEPREFIX e:\psoft8\he900d9a\appserv\prcs\HE90D9A\log_output\&lt;/p&gt; ! FolderMove &#39;{FILEPREFIX}&#39; to $fileNameConcat &#39;SQR_PROCNAME_&#39; with $fileNameConcat $prcs_process_instance with $fileNameConcat &#39;\&#39; with $fileName ! File.Concat &#39;PROCNAME_&#39; with $fileNameConcat $prcs_process_instance with $fileNameConcat &#39;.LTR&#39; with $fileName New-Report $fileName&lt;/span&gt;" />
