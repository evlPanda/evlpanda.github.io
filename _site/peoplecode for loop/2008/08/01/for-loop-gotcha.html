<meta name="description" content="From a recent email from a collegue. It seems that For loops only evaluate the conditions once, when the loop is entered: Hi all, I have just encountered an ‘interesting’ property of for loops. It appears that they hard-code the number that they loop through until, and there doesn’t seem to be any way to affect this number. I.e. If you have a rowset and are looping through it via a for loop - &amp;I = 1 to &amp;rowset.activerowcount, and you add a row to the rowset, the for loop will only go through the original number of rows – the added row will not be part of the &amp;rowset.activerowcount of the loop. (If there were originally 10 rows in the rowset, and I add another 5 rows to the rowset as part of the for loop, &amp;I will only ever get to 10 – not 15). If you wish to loop through a rowset (or any variable number loops) you should use a while or a repeat loop, as the conditions are re-evaluated each time the loop comes to the conditional part (the top of the while statement, and the until of the repeat statement). Hope that helps people." />
