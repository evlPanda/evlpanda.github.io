I am a PeopleSoft developer currently contracting to the University of
Queensland.

I enjoy solving problems, and then improving the solution until
it looks simple.

I have almost 20 years experience with the following tools and acronyms:
- PeopleCode
- OOP
- Application Engine
- SQL
- Integration Broker

And more recently:
- WorkCentres
- JavaScript
- Notifications
- BI Publisher

...and many more I neither mention nor remember.

I definitely do not have experience with Activity Manager, and I recommend you
avoid it at all cost.

Hobbies: Muay Thai, Windsurfing, Programming, Board Games.
